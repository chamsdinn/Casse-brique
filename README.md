# Brick Breaker
A Javascript game using canvas, the goal is to break all the bricks.
## About implementation
using canvas to draw the bricks, ball and the paddle
## technical difficulty
Honestly without a tutorial found (thanks to Flo) on mdn i couldn't do the collision between the ball the paddle and bricks.
## what's next
add mouse control to the paddle
modify wall bricks structure ti make more challenging
